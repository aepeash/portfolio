   <p>7th Century A.D.
       The history of the cookie begins with the
       cultivation of sugar in 7th century Persia.
       Luxurious cakes and pastries were a well-known
       indulgence of the incredibly wealthy Persian empire.
       During the crusades and development of the spice trade,
       sugar spread through the Mediterranean and then to Northern
       Europe. As the use and availability of sugar spread across
       the globe, so did the cooking techniques and recipes from Persia.

       14th Century
       By the 14th-century wafer-like cakes could be purchased in Paris.

       15th Century
       The first known cookbook called Goode Huswife’s
       Jewel by Thomas Dawson with a cookie recipe was published.

       16th – 17th Century
       Tea cakes became very popular in Europe.
       These butter cookies closely resembled today’s
       shortbread cookie, but with less sugar. They were not
       quite as sweet as your traditional cookie. Instead,
       they were richer and more buttery. As the Dutch settled in
       America, they brought koeckjes (their version of this cake
       that was later Americanized to be spelled cookie) with them.
       The first reference to a cookie in America is 1703 when
       it was served by the Dutch at a funeral in New York.
