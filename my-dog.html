<h1 id="main">Buddy</h1>
<p>This page is all about the light of my life, my parents dog Buddy.</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Buddy is a pomeranian my dad randomly adpoted from Facebook one night in the
summer of 2016, without telling anyone in my family. But after one night Buddy captured our
hearts and became the third Peash child. My family has
always had dogs when I was growing up, but this was the first time we had a
small dog. We soon came to find out small dogs are much different then large dogs.</p>

<p>I find now that both my brother and I have left the house my parents have replaced
us with buddy. I often find when I call either my mom or dad our conversations revolve
around Buddy and his well being. I really think Buddy lives a better life
then most people.</p>

<p>After adopting Buddy we came to the realization he is much larger then the
standards for a Pomeranian, being double the standard weight. Our vet never said any thing about it
but after doing some research this summer my brother came to the conclusion buddy is a German Spitz.
If you follow this link you can decide for yourself <a href="https://www.loveyourdog.com/german-spitz-vs-pomeranian/">
